### Hi, I'm Allison! 😄

🚚 I've been in the concrete industry for 18+ years

🌱 I'm currently learning Python and C#. I've successfully completed courses at the U of A for HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, React, UI/UX. 

⚡ Outside of school and work you can catch me:

  - In the gym smashing PR's
  - Baking up a storm in the kitchen 
  - At the local **metal** show 🤘
